# Adaptiv Health Patient App - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Transform the current build from bulky card layouts into a professional, compact fitness app (Zepp/SnapFitness style) with all essential backend integrations.

---

## Phase 1: UI/UX Redesign (Foundation)
**Timeline: Week 1-2 | Priority: CRITICAL**

### Goals:
- Replace oversized card blocks with compact, information-dense layouts
- Implement modern design system (spacing, typography, colors)
- Prepare component structure for all backend data types

### Key Changes:

#### Home Screen Redesign
- **Current Issue:** Giant HR display takes half the screen
- **New Approach:** 
  - Compact vital signs grid (4 cards: HR, SpO2, BP, HRV)
  - Each card shows current value + mini trend line
  - Color-coded status (green/yellow/red based on risk_level)
  - Quick action buttons below vitals

#### Navigation Structure
- Replace simple bottom nav with tab-based system:
  - **Home** - Vitals & status
  - **Fitness** - Plans, sessions, recommendations
  - **Recovery** - Post-workout insights, breathing exercises
  - **Health** - Chatbot, messages, resources
  - **Profile** - User settings, data sharing

#### Design System Reference Points
- **Zepp App:** Minimalist cards, color-coded zones, metric grids
- **SnapFitness:** Compact summaries, action-focused UI, progress rings
- **Adaptiv Requirements:** Medical alert styling, HIPAA-compliant aesthetics

---

## Phase 2: Fitness Plans & Suggestions Module
**Timeline: Week 2-3 | Backend Integration: /recommendations endpoint**

### What Backend Provides:

## Phase 3: Diet & Nutrition Module
**Timeline: Week 3-4 | Backend Integration: New endpoint needed**

### Current Gap:
Backend doesn't have dedicated nutrition endpoint yet. Needs implementation:

```python
# Proposed endpoint (coordinate with backend team)
GET /nutrition/recommendations?user_id={id}&date={date}
{
  meals: [
    {
      meal_type: "breakfast|lunch|dinner|snack",
      suggested_items: ["oatmeal", "berries", "yogurt"],
      calories_target: 500,
      sodium_limit_mg: 300,
      suggested_recipes: [...],
      benefits: "Heart-healthy, low sodium",
      nutritionist_notes: "Based on your recovery phase"
    }
  ],
  daily_nutrition_goals: {
    calories: 2000,
    sodium_mg: 2300,
    potassium_mg: 3500,
    water_liters: 2.5
  },
  restrictions: ["high_sodium_foods", "saturated_fats"],
  assigned_nutritionist: "Dr. Amanda White"
}
```

### Implementation:

#### New Screen: "Nutrition"
1. **Daily Nutrition Summary**
   - Progress rings: Calories, Sodium, Water intake
   - Status indicators (on track/caution/over limit)

2. **Meal Suggestions**
   - Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snacks
   - Recipe cards with:
     - Ingredients list
     - Prep time
     - Nutritional info
     - Heart-health benefits

3. **Nutrition Log**
   - Quick add buttons for common foods
   - Nutritional calculation
   - Daily total tracking

4. **Contact Nutritionist**
   - Link to messaging with assigned nutritionist
   - View past nutrition advice
   - Schedule nutrition consultation

#### Design Pattern:
- Similar to fitness cards but with food focus
- Color-code macros (proteins/carbs/fats)
- Show alignment with cardiovascular guidelines

---

## Phase 4: AI Health Chatbot
**Timeline: Week 4-5 | Backend Integration: /alerts/natural-language endpoint**

### What Backend Provides:
```
# LLM-generated human-readable alerts
GET /alerts/natural-language?alert_type={type}
Response: "Your heart rate was elevated for 15 minutes during walking. 
This is within safe limits, but consider taking a 5-minute rest break 
next time to optimize recovery."

# Risk summary explanation
GET /risk-summary/natural-language?include_recommendations=true
Response: Plain English risk explanation + next steps

# Model explanation (SHAP feature importance)
GET /predict/explain?session_id={id}
Response: "Your elevated heart rate (92%) and moderate HRV (45%) 
contributed to a moderate risk score today. Continue current activity."
```

### Implementation:

#### New Screen: "Health Coach"
1. **Chat Interface**
   - Patient asks health questions
   - Chatbot provides cardiovascular-specific guidance
   - Uses backend NLP endpoints for responses

2. **Quick Questions**
   - "Should I exercise today?" → Checks risk_score
   - "Why was my alert triggered?" → Uses /predict/explain
   - "What can I do better?" → Combines recommendations + trends

3. **Daily Insights**
   - Morning briefing on:
     - Today's risk level
     - Recommended activities
     - Nutritional focus
   - Evening summary of:
     - Session performance
     - Recovery metrics
     - Tomorrow's forecast

#### System Architecture:
```python
# Patient question
POST /chat/message
{
  user_id: "user123",
  message: "Why was my heart rate so high yesterday?",
  context: {
    latest_session_id: "sess456",
    latest_vital_signs: {...}
  }
}

# Response combines:
# 1. Natural language alert explanation
# 2. Risk factors from predict/explain
# 3. Recommendations for improvement
# 4. Trend context from user history

Response: "Your elevated heart rate yesterday (peak 145 BPM) was 
primarily driven by high activity intensity. However, your recovery 
was good. Today I'd recommend a lighter session to maintain balance."
```

#### UI Components:
- **ChatBubble** - Message display
- **QuickReplyButtons** - Common questions
- **InsightCard** - Formatted health insight
- **MetricContext** - Show relevant vital in explanation

---

## Phase 5: Doctor Direct Messaging
**Timeline: Week 5-6 | Backend Integration: New endpoint needed**

### Current Gap:
Backend has Care Team info but needs messaging endpoint:

```python
# Proposed endpoint (coordinate with backend)
GET /messaging/conversations?user_id={id}
[
  {
    conversation_id: "conv123",
    clinician: {
      name: "Dr. Emily Rodriguez",
      role: "Cardiologist",
      email: "e.rodriguez@adaptihealth.com",
      availability_status: "Available"
    },
    last_message: {...},
    unread_count: 2
  }
]

GET /messaging/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages?limit=50

POST /messaging/send
{
  conversation_id: "conv123",
  message: "I had some chest discomfort during my workout yesterday",
  attachments: ["vital_summary_2024_02_15"]
}

# Real-time updates via WebSocket
WS /messaging/stream?user_id={id}&conversation_id={conv_id}
```

### Implementation:

#### New Screen: "Messages"
1. **Clinician List**
   - All assigned care team members
   - Status indicator (Available/Busy/Offline)
   - Role badges (Cardiologist/Nurse/Nutritionist)
   - Unread message count

2. **Conversation Thread**
   - Message history with care team member
   - Timestamps & read receipts
   - Ability to attach vital sign reports
   - Quick action: Schedule appointment

3. **Message Composition**
   - Rich text editor
   - Attach vital summaries/activity sessions
   - Medical terminology suggestions (non-invasive)
   - Send & schedule options

#### Design Pattern:
- Healthcare messaging standard (clear, professional)
- Distinguish system messages from user/clinician messages
- Highlight urgent/priority messages

---

- All API calls over HTTPS
- JWT token management with refresh logic
- Biometric auth for app unlock

### Performance
- Lazy load screens to reduce initial load time
- Cache vital sign history locally (last 30 days)
- Compress images for nutrition/recovery modules
- Optimize graph rendering for activity history

### Offline Capability
